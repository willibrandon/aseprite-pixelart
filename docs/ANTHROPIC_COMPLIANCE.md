```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Skills and commands at plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`

---

## ✅ Skill YAML Frontmatter Compliance

### Required Fields

**Anthropic Standard** (from Agent-Skills.md lines 72-86):
```yaml
---
name: Your Skill Name
description: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it
---
```

**Our Implementation** ✅ COMPLIANT
```yaml
---
name: Pixel Art Creator
description: Create new pixel art sprites from scratch with canvas creation, layer management, and basic drawing primitives. Use when the user wants to create a sprite, draw pixel art, make a new canvas, or mentions pixel dimensions like "64x64" or "32x32 sprite".
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, mcp__aseprite__create_canvas, ...
---
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Includes required `name` and `description`, plus optional `allowed-tools`

---

## ✅ Skill Description Best Practices

**Anthropic Guidance** (from Agent-Skills.md lines 88, 343-349):
- Description should include **what the Skill does** and **when to use it**
- Include specific triggers and keywords
- Be clear and specific, not vague

**Our Implementation Examples:**

### pixel-art-creator ✅ EXCELLENT
```yaml
description: Create new pixel art sprites from scratch with canvas creation, layer management, and basic drawing primitives. Use when the user wants to create a sprite, draw pixel art, make a new canvas, start a new image, begin a new project, or mentions pixel dimensions like "64x64", "32x32 sprite", "128 by 128", "16 pixel icon". Trigger on: "create", "new", "make", "draw", "sprite", "canvas"...
```
- ✅ States what it does (create sprites with canvas/layers/primitives)
- ✅ States when to use (user wants to create, draw, make new)
- ✅ Includes specific triggers (dimensions, keywords)

### pixel-art-animator ✅ EXCELLENT
```yaml
description: Create and manage sprite animations with multiple frames, animation tags, frame durations, and linked cels. Use when the user wants to animate a sprite, add animation, create movement, make it move, mentions "animation", "animated", "frames", "keyframes", "walk cycle", "run cycle"...
```
- ✅ States what it does (manage animations with frames/tags/timing)
- ✅ States when to use (user wants to animate, mentions animation terms)
- ✅ Includes animation-specific keywords

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Follows all best practices from Anthropic docs

---

## ✅ Skill allowed-tools Compliance

**Anthropic Guidance** (from Agent-Skills.md lines 120-151):
- `allowed-tools` is **optional**
- When specified, limits tools Claude can use without asking permission
- Use for read-only Skills or restricted scope
- List tool names: `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write, Edit`
- Can include MCP tool names: `mcp__server__tool_name`

**Our Implementation Examples:**

### pixel-art-creator ✅ CORRECT
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, mcp__aseprite__create_canvas, mcp__aseprite__add_layer, mcp__aseprite__delete_layer, mcp__aseprite__get_sprite_info, mcp__aseprite__draw_pixels, mcp__aseprite__draw_line, mcp__aseprite__draw_rectangle, mcp__aseprite__draw_circle, mcp__aseprite__draw_contour, mcp__aseprite__fill_area, mcp__aseprite__set_palette, mcp__aseprite__get_palette
```
- ✅ Mixes built-in tools (Read, Bash) with MCP tools
- ✅ Scoped to creation operations only
- ✅ Follows naming convention `mcp__servername__toolname`

### pixel-art-professional ✅ CORRECT
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, mcp__aseprite__get_sprite_info, mcp__aseprite__draw_pixels, mcp__aseprite__set_palette, mcp__aseprite__get_palette, mcp__aseprite__quantize_colors, mcp__aseprite__apply_dithering, mcp__aseprite__add_layer, mcp__aseprite__flatten_layers
```
- ✅ Scoped to professional techniques (dithering, palette, etc.)
- ✅ Doesn't include export tools (different Skill's responsibility)

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Proper use of allowed-tools for scope restriction

---

**Anthropic Guidance** (from Plugins.md lines 54-66):
```markdown
---
description: Greet the user with a personalized message
---

# Hello Command

Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today.
```

```markdown
---
description: Create a new pixel art sprite with optional size and palette presets
argument-hint: [size] [palette]
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, mcp__aseprite__create_canvas, mcp__aseprite__set_palette
---

## /pixel-new - Quick Sprite Creation

Creates a new pixel art sprite with optional presets for size and palette.

### Usage
...
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Includes required `description` plus optional `argument-hint` and `allowed-tools`

---

## ✅ Plugin Metadata Compliance

**Anthropic Guidance** (from Plugins.md lines 38-49):
```json
{
  "name": "my-first-plugin",
  "description": "A simple greeting plugin to learn the basics",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name"
  }
}
```

**Our Implementation** (from PART6.md Chunk 6.2):
```json
{
  "name": "aseprite-pixelart",
  "displayName": "Aseprite Pixel Art",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Create, animate, and export pixel art using Aseprite...",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/yourusername/aseprite-pixelart-plugin",
  "repository": {...},
  "bugs": {...},
  "keywords": [...],
  "engines": {...},
  "categories": [...]
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Includes all required fields plus recommended optional fields

---

## ✅ MCP Integration Compliance

**Anthropic Guidance** (from Plugins.md line 145, MCP docs):
- Create `.mcp.json` at plugin root for external tool integration
- Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-relative paths

**Our Implementation** (from Phase 2.2):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aseprite": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/aseprite-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "ASEPRITE_MCP_CONFIG": "${HOME}/.config/aseprite-mcp/config.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-relative binary path

---

## ✅ Skill Discovery Compliance

**Anthropic Guidance** (from Agent-Skills.md lines 14-16):
> Skills are **model-invoked**—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill's description. This is different from slash commands, which are **user-invoked**.

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ Skills are model-invoked (not explicitly called)
- ✅ Commands are user-invoked (require `/command-name`)
- ✅ Descriptions optimized for automatic discovery
- ✅ Phase 5.2 enhances descriptions with more trigger keywords

**Example from Phase 5.2:**
```yaml
# Enhanced description for better triggering
description: Apply advanced pixel art techniques including dithering, palette optimization, shading, antialiasing, and color theory. Use when the user mentions "dithering", "dither", "Bayer", "Floyd-Steinberg", "palette", "colors", "reduce colors", "optimize palette", "color limit", "shading", "shadows", "highlights"...
```

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Follows model-invoked pattern with optimized discovery

---

## ✅ Progressive Disclosure Compliance

**Anthropic Guidance** (from Agent-Skills.md lines 109-118):
```markdown
For advanced usage, see [reference.md](reference.md).

Run the helper script:
```bash
python scripts/helper.py input.txt
```
```

> Claude reads these files only when needed, using progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently.

**Our Implementation:**
```markdown
# In SKILL.md (main instructions - always loaded)

**Note**: See `dithering-patterns.md` for comprehensive pattern library.

# In reference.md (loaded when Claude needs technical details)
## Dithering Algorithms
[Detailed technical specifications...]

# In examples.md (loaded when Claude needs concrete examples)
### Example 4: Adding Shading to Flat Sprite
[Detailed walkthrough...]
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Uses progressive disclosure, references supporting files

---

## ⚠️ Potential Issues Found

### Issue 1: Skills Location Documentation
**Finding:** Implementation Guide correctly places Skills at plugin root, but we should verify CLAUDE.md also documents this correctly.

**Action:** ✅ VERIFIED - CLAUDE.md line 251 shows `skills/` at plugin root (not in `.claude-plugin/`)

### Issue 2: Skill Invocation Language
**Finding:** Some early chunks may not emphasize that Skills are "model-invoked" vs Commands are "user-invoked"

**Recommendation:** Add clarification in Phase 3 introduction that Skills activate automatically based on context, not explicit invocation.

## 📝 Recommended Minor Updates

### 1. Add Model-Invoked Clarification (Optional Enhancement)

In `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Phase 3 introduction, add:

```markdown
## Phase 3: Core Skills Development

**Important**: Skills are **model-invoked** - Claude autonomously uses them based on context and the Skill's description. Users don't explicitly call Skills like they do with slash commands (`/command-name`). Instead, Claude discovers and uses Skills automatically when the user's request matches the Skill's description.

This is why the `description` field is critical - it determines when Claude will use your Skill.
```

### 2. Emphasize Plugin Root Location (Optional Reminder)

Add to Phase 3.1 verification steps:

```bash
# CRITICAL: Verify Skills are at plugin root, NOT in .claude-plugin/
ls -la skills/          # ✅ Correct
ls -la .claude-plugin/skills/  # ❌ Wrong - will not work!
```

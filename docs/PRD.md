## Executive Summary

The Aseprite Pixel Art Plugin for Claude Code enables developers and artists to create, edit, and export professional pixel art using natural language commands. By integrating the aseprite-mcp Model Context Protocol server with Claude Code's plugin system, users can leverage Aseprite's powerful pixel art capabilities without leaving their development environment.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Create pixel art using natural language instead of manual GUI interactions
- Automate sprite creation workflows for game development
- Access professional pixel art tools (dithering, palette management, shading) conversationally
- Seamless integration with existing Claude Code workflows

**Primary Target:** Game developers, indie developers, pixel artists, and hobbyists using Claude Code for development.

## Product Overview

### What We're Building

A Claude Code plugin that provides:
1. **Four specialized Skills** for autonomous pixel art assistance
2. **User-invoked commands** for direct control
3. **Bundled MCP server** for Aseprite integration
4. **Comprehensive documentation** and examples

### What We're NOT Building

- A standalone pixel art editor
- A replacement for Aseprite
- A GUI application
- Support for other pixel art tools beyond Aseprite

### Product Positioning

This plugin positions Claude Code as a comprehensive development environment that extends beyond traditional code editing to include asset creation workflows, specifically targeting the game development and pixel art communities.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**Problem 1: Context Switching**
- Developers must switch between Claude Code and Aseprite GUI
- Breaks flow state and reduces productivity
- Manual GUI operations are time-consuming for repetitive tasks

**Problem 2: Limited Automation**
- Creating sprites requires manual clicking and drawing
- Batch operations (e.g., creating multiple sprite variants) are tedious
- No way to automate sprite creation from descriptions

**Problem 3: Learning Curve**
- Aseprite has many advanced features (dithering, palette management)
- New users don't know which tools to use for specific effects
- Professional techniques require research and practice

**Problem 4: Integration Gap**
- No existing integration between AI assistants and pixel art tools
- Cannot leverage AI for creative asset generation
- Missed opportunity for AI-assisted pixel art workflows

### User Pain Points

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Glossary

**Agent Skill (Skill)**: Model-invoked capability that Claude loads autonomously based on task context. Defined in `SKILL.md` files within `skills/` directory.

**Aseprite**: Professional pixel art and animation tool. Desktop application for creating sprites.

**aseprite-mcp**: Model Context Protocol server (written in Go) that exposes Aseprite capabilities to AI assistants via 40+ MCP tools.

**Canvas**: The drawing surface in Aseprite. Defined by width, height, and color mode (RGB, Grayscale, or Indexed).

**Cel**: A single layer in a single frame of an animation. Linked cels share image data across frames.

**Claude Code**: Anthropic's official CLI tool for Claude, providing an interactive development environment with extensibility via plugins, skills, commands, hooks, and MCP integration.

**Dithering**: Technique for creating the illusion of color depth in limited palette images by using patterns of available colors.

**Frame**: A single image in an animation sequence. Sprites can have 1+ frames.

**Indexed Color Mode**: Color mode where each pixel references a palette index (0-255) rather than storing direct RGB values. Common in retro game graphics.

**Layer**: Separate drawing surface within a sprite. Allows organizing sprite elements (e.g., background, character, effects).

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Open-source protocol for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources.

**Palette**: Set of colors available for use in a sprite. Limited in Indexed mode (1-256 colors), unlimited in RGB mode.

**Plugin**: Bundled extension for Claude Code containing commands, agents, skills, hooks, and/or MCP servers.

**Slash Command**: User-invoked custom prompt defined in Markdown file. Triggered by typing `/command-name`.

**Sprite**: The complete pixel art asset, including all layers, frames, and metadata.

**Spritesheet**: Single image containing multiple animation frames arranged in a grid or strip. Used by game engines to load animations.

**Subagent**: Specialized AI assistant with separate context window and custom system prompt. Can be invoked automatically or explicitly.

### Appendix F: Open Questions

**Q1:** Should the plugin include a template library of common sprites (characters, tiles, UI elements)?
- **Consideration:** Adds value but increases plugin size and scope
- **Decision:** Defer to v1.1, focus on core functionality for v1.0

**Q2:** Should the plugin support importing/exporting to other formats (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP)?
- **Consideration:** Useful but adds complexity
- **Decision:** Out of scope for v1.0, Aseprite handles most formats already

**Q3:** Should Skills be allowed to run without user confirmation for destructive operations?
- **Consideration:** Speed vs. safety tradeoff
- **Decision:** For v1.0, request confirmation for destructive ops (delete, overwrite), allow read-only ops without confirmation

**Q4:** Should the plugin include example sprites/projects?
- **Consideration:** Helps learning, increases repository size
- **Decision:** Include 2-3 small example sprites (<10KB total) in documentation

**Q5:** Should the plugin support remote Aseprite instances (e.g., Aseprite running on different machine)?
- **Consideration:** Advanced use case, adds complexity
- **Decision:** Out of scope for v1.0, local-only

**Q6:** Should there be a `/pixel-undo` command for reverting operations?
- **Consideration:** Useful for mistakes, but Aseprite has built-in undo
- **Decision:** Out of scope for v1.0, users can use Aseprite's native undo

# Pixel Art Creator

## Overview

This Skill enables creation of new pixel art sprites with full control over canvas properties, layers, and basic drawing operations. It's the foundational Skill for all pixel art workflows.

## When to Use

Use this Skill when the user:
- Wants to "create a sprite" or "make pixel art"
- Mentions sprite dimensions (e.g., "64x64", "32 by 32", "128 pixels wide")
- Asks to "draw" basic shapes (pixels, lines, rectangles, circles)
- Needs to set up a canvas or layers
- Mentions color modes (RGB, Grayscale, Indexed)

**Trigger Keywords:** create, sprite, canvas, draw, pixel art, dimensions, layer, new sprite

## Instructions

### 1. Creating a Canvas

When the user requests a sprite, create the canvas first:

**Color Modes:**
- **RGB**: Full color (24-bit), best for modern pixel art
- **Grayscale**: Shades of gray only, for monochrome art
- **Indexed**: Limited palette (1-256 colors), for retro game art

**Recommended Sizes:**
- **Icons**: 16x16, 24x24, 32x32
- **Characters**: 32x32, 48x48, 64x64
- **Tiles**: 16x16, 32x32, 64x64
- **Scenes**: 128x128, 256x256, 320x240 (retro resolution)

Use `mcp__aseprite__create_canvas` with parameters:
- `width`: 1-65535 pixels
- `height`: 1-65535 pixels
- `color_mode`: "RGB", "Grayscale", or "Indexed"

### 2. Managing Layers

**Adding Layers:**
Use `mcp__aseprite__add_layer` to organize sprite elements:
- Background layer for solid colors or backgrounds
- Character layer for main subject
- Effects layer for highlights, shadows, outlines
- Detail layer for accessories or fine details

**Layer Workflow:**
1. Create canvas
2. Add named layers (e.g., "Background", "Character", "Effects")
3. Draw on specific layers
4. Use layers for organization and editing flexibility

**Important:** Cannot delete the last layer in a sprite.

### 3. Drawing Primitives

**Draw Individual Pixels:**
Use `mcp__aseprite__draw_pixels` for precise pixel placement:
- Supports batch operations (multiple pixels at once)
- Accepts colors in hex format (#RRGGBB) or palette indices
- Can snap to nearest palette color (for Indexed mode)

Example:
```
Draw pixels at coordinates:
- (10, 10) in red (#FF0000)
- (11, 10) in red (#FF0000)
- (12, 10) in red (#FF0000)
```

**Draw Lines:**
Use `mcp__aseprite__draw_line`:
- Straight lines between two points
- Useful for outlines, edges, connecting points

**Draw Rectangles:**
Use `mcp__aseprite__draw_rectangle`:
- Filled or outline mode
- Perfect for backgrounds, UI elements, platforms

**Draw Circles/Ellipses:**
Use `mcp__aseprite__draw_circle`:
- Filled or outline mode
- For round objects, planets, effects

**Draw Contours (Polylines/Polygons):**
Use `mcp__aseprite__draw_contour`:
- Connect multiple points
- Useful for complex shapes, terrain, irregular outlines

**Flood Fill:**
Use `mcp__aseprite__fill_area`:
- Fill connected pixels of the same color
- Like a paint bucket tool
- Great for filling large areas quickly

### 4. Working with Colors

**Setting Colors:**
- **Hex Format**: #RRGGBB (e.g., #FF0000 for red)
- **RGB**: Specify red, green, blue values (0-255)
- **Palette Index**: For Indexed mode (0-255)

**Common Colors:**
- Red: #FF0000
- Green: #00FF00
- Blue: #0000FF
- Yellow: #FFFF00
- Cyan: #00FFFF
- Magenta: #FF00FF
- Black: #000000
- White: #FFFFFF

**Color Palettes:**
For Indexed color mode, set the palette first:
- Use `mcp__aseprite__set_palette` with array of hex colors
- Example: ["#000000", "#FFFFFF", "#FF0000", "#00FF00"]

### 5. Workflow Best Practices

**Typical Creation Workflow:**
1. **Understand Requirements**
   - What size sprite?
   - What color mode?
   - What style (modern vs retro)?

2. **Create Canvas**
   - Choose appropriate dimensions
   - Select color mode (RGB for modern, Indexed for retro)

3. **Set Up Layers** (optional but recommended)
   - Add layers for organization
   - Name layers descriptively

4. **Set Palette** (for Indexed mode)
   - Define limited color palette
   - Use retro-appropriate palettes (NES: 16 colors, Game Boy: 4 colors)

5. **Draw Basic Shapes**
   - Start with outline
   - Fill with colors
   - Add details

6. **Verify Result**
   - Use `mcp__aseprite__get_sprite_info` to check properties
   - Describe what was created to user

7. **Prepare for Export** (if requested)
   - Hand off to pixel-art-exporter Skill

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Sprite

**User Request:** "Create a 32x32 sprite with a red circle"

**Approach:**
1. Create 32x32 RGB canvas
2. Draw filled circle in center (radius 12) in red
3. Confirm creation

### Example 2: Layered Sprite

**User Request:** "Make a 64x64 sprite with a blue background and a yellow character"

**Approach:**
1. Create 64x64 RGB canvas
2. Add layer "Background"
3. Fill entire canvas with blue (#0000FF) on Background layer
4. Add layer "Character"
5. Draw yellow (#FFFF00) rectangle or shape on Character layer
6. Confirm layers and contents

### Example 3: Indexed Color Sprite

**User Request:** "Create a 48x48 Game Boy style sprite"

**Approach:**
1. Create 48x48 Indexed canvas
2. Set Game Boy palette: ["#0F380F", "#306230", "#8BAC0F", "#9BBC0F"]
3. Draw using 4-color palette
4. Use pixel-perfect drawing

### Example 4: Complex Shape

**User Request:** "Draw a pixelated tree on a 64x64 canvas"

**Approach:**
1. Create 64x64 RGB canvas
2. Draw brown (#8B4513) rectangle for trunk (using draw_rectangle)
3. Draw green (#228B22) irregular shape for foliage (using draw_contour or multiple rectangles)
4. Add details with individual pixels
5. Describe the tree to user

## Technical Details

### Canvas Properties
- **Width/Height**: 1-65535 pixels (practical limit usually <1024)
- **Color Modes**:
  - RGB: 24-bit color (16.7 million colors)
  - Grayscale: 8-bit (256 shades of gray)
  - Indexed: 1-256 colors from palette

### Drawing Coordinates
- Origin (0, 0) is top-left corner
- X increases rightward
- Y increases downward

### Performance
- Batch pixel operations when possible
- Drawing operations complete in <100ms typically
- Large canvases (>512x512) may take slightly longer

### Limitations
- Cannot create canvas smaller than 1x1
- Cannot create canvas larger than 65535x65535 (practical limit much lower)
- Cannot delete last layer
- Indexed mode palette limited to 256 colors maximum

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Quick Sprite
For simple requests like "create a sprite":
- Default to 64x64 RGB canvas
- Add basic shape or placeholder
- Ask user for refinements

### Pattern: Retro Game Sprite
For retro-style requests:
- Use Indexed color mode
- Set appropriate palette (NES, Game Boy, C64, etc.)
- Use limited colors and pixel-perfect drawing

### Pattern: Icon Creation
For icon requests:
- Use 16x16, 24x24, or 32x32 dimensions
- RGB mode for modern icons
- Simple, recognizable shapes
- High contrast colors

## Integration with Other Skills

- **Hand off to pixel-art-animator** when user mentions "animation", "frames", or "movement"
- **Hand off to pixel-art-professional** when user asks for "dithering", "shading", or "palette refinement"
- **Hand off to pixel-art-exporter** when user asks to "export", "save", or mentions file formats

## Error Handling

**If canvas creation fails:**
- Check dimensions are valid (1-65535)
- Verify color mode is spelled correctly
- Suggest alternative dimensions if too large

**If drawing fails:**
- Verify coordinates are within canvas bounds
- Check color format is valid hex (#RRGGBB)
- For Indexed mode, ensure palette is set first

**If layer operations fail:**
- Cannot delete last layer (inform user)
- Layer names should be descriptive strings

## Success Indicators

You've successfully used this Skill when:
- Canvas created with correct dimensions and color mode
- Drawing operations complete without errors
- User can see or understand what was created
- Sprite is ready for next steps (animation, export, refinement)
